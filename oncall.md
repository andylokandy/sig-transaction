# On-call roster

## Responsibilities

Any member of the team at any level is eligible to volunteer for on-call duty.

The on-call period is one week, Monday morning to Monday morning. You are expected to do the following within 24 hours (taking more time at weekends or over holidays is fine); you are not expected to answer immediately or be present outside normal working hours.

* Welcome new users on Slack or in GitHub.
* Ensure questions on Slack or in GitHub comments (in the TiKV, rust-client, and sig-transaction repos) are answered (the person on-call does not need to answer the question, but they should direct somebody to answer it).
* Triage any new issues in the above repos or TiDB. Triage in this case means applying the appropriate labels, and alerting and assigning somebody in the SIG if the issue is high priority.
* Run the weekly meeting.
* Ensure any open PRs are making progress, including getting any needed reviews.
